# BLP_model_extension_version_1
Here, I implement practical and novel extensions to the BLP model. BLP model is very popular in Econometrics. However, it is not used widely in industry due to some limitations regarding this model. In this repo, I will implement some novel and practical extensions to the original BLP model. 

## 1. Extension 1. 

$U_{ij} = \alpha p_j + \gamma b_j + \varepsilon_j + \epsilon_{ij}$

$\epsilon_{ij}=\eta_{ig} + (1 - \sigma_g) \v_{ij}$
